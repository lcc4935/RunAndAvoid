            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I started with the Circle Blast homework to 
                have a place to start. I started by getting 
                rid of all the unnecessary aspects from it for 
                my game. From there I worked on the movable 
                character. I then started on the circles in terms 
                of making more with different colors and how many 
                there were. I then edited the increase and decrease 
                life to match with the circle colors. I then made 
                it so that when all the blue circles are gone it 
                moves onto the next level rather than all the circles. 
                After that I added in sound based on which circle 
                color was hit. I then went about figuring out how to 
                get the character to shrink and grow based on the green 
                and red circles. After this I was happy with the game 
                and how it turned out so I moved onto the HTML and CSS.

        <div id = "sources">
            <h2>Sources</h2>
            <p>I got the color scheme from 
                <a href = "https://coolors.co/000000-0000ff-7d8ca3-79a9d1-ceb992">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I got the sounds from 
                <a href = "https://freesound.org/">this</a> website.</p>

        <div id = "requirements">
            <h2>How Met Requirements</h2>
            <p>I used PIXI to make this game. The game is 
                straightforward and easy to play. There are 
                also instructions on the side to help out 
                with any confusion. There are images and 
                sounds in the game. The HTML and CSS are 
                valid and the CSS is in an external style sheet.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id = "concept">
            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>You are a character. There will be circles moving around the screen. 
                There will be three different colored circles. 
                Everytime you hit a green circle you grow, but everytime 
                you hit a red circle you shrink. Blue circles let you move 
                onto the next level. If you shrink too much you lose. 
            </p>

        <div id = "genre">
            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>This is an avoidance game.</p>
        </div>

        <div id = "platform">
            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>This would be a desktop game.</p>
        </div>

        <div id = "story">
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>This game is mainly abstract. If there is aything, 
                the mood would be fear of getting hit. 
                The theme would be that even as you grow and succeed, 
                life can become more difficult.

        <div id = "Ae">
            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>This would be an abstract graphic style game.</p>
        </div>

        <div id = "gameplay">
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The player will be able to move the character on the screen 
                with the mouse. This will translate over to touch on mobile. 
                There will be instructions at the beginning.
